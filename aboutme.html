                <p class="short-bio">My name is Kris Nguyen, and I am a web developer. With an inherent love of writing code to solve intricate issues, I have been programming since age 16.
                    I taught myself how to code through reading books and watching online tutorials. My love for developing innovative and creative websites for clients is what has opened opportunities for me to work
                     in-house and remotely on projects for startups, agencies, leading brands, and charities. I care deeply about creating top-notch, useful and appealing sites that meet the needs of
                      clients and that help people to make a difference. I have been practicing web developing professionally for two years now. I got my first professional experience working as an intern at 
                      a private web development company in my state. I worked there for a period of 6 months, and during that time I gained important skills in JavaScript, back-end basics, search engine optimization,
                    testing and debugging skills, and responsive design skills among others. I was also able to become fluent in computer languages and an excellent team player when it came to team efforts to manipulate code. I 
                     believe that there is more room for me to develop professionally, and this is what prompted me to join this company. My love for web developing and dedication to my profession will
                      make me an effective member of your team. I look forward to working with you. </p>
